# Title
Car Price Prediction using Ridge Regression

## Description
This project implements Ridge regression, a variant of linear regression, to predict car prices based on various features such as wheel-base, length, width, and more. It involves preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## The Problem It Solves
Car price prediction is a common problem faced by car buyers, sellers, and analysts. This project aims to provide a reliable and accurate method for predicting car prices, which can be beneficial for various stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Use Cases
Car Dealerships: Dealerships can use the model to estimate prices for new and used cars, helping them make pricing decisions.
Consumers: Consumers can use the model to get an estimate of a fair price when buying or selling a car, aiding in negotiations.
Analysts: Analysts can use the model to study trends in car prices over time and understand the factors that influence prices.
Challenges You Ran Into
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables required careful preprocessing to ensure the model's accuracy.
Feature Selection: Selecting the right features that have a significant impact on car prices while avoiding overfitting was challenging.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning the alpha parameter in Ridge regression to balance between bias and variance was crucial for optimal performance.
Evaluation: Ensuring the model's performance was accurately evaluated using metrics like R-squared and cross-validation scores.
# Exact Steps to Test the Project
Data Preparation: Download the 'carprice.csv' dataset or use your own car price dataset. Ensure it is in a format that can be used for regression analysis.
Install Dependencies: Ensure all necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy) are installed in your Python environment.
Run the Code: Use the provided Python code to preprocess the data, train the Ridge regression model, and evaluate its performance.
Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or evaluate its performance using cross-validation.
